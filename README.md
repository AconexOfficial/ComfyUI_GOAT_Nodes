# 🐐 ComfyUI GOAT Nodes 🐐

(README still under construction!)

Welcome to the **ComfyUI GOAT Nodes**! 
These custom nodes both cover things, which had to be done through the use of multiple nodes or simply things, that were not performant enough and had other problems. These nodes currently are categorized into Image manipulation, Math utilities, and Postprocessing effects.

## Introduction

This project includes a variety of custom nodes to mostly enhance image processing within **ComfyUI**. Each node serves a specific purpose, whether it's manipulating image resolution, applying grain or processing numbers quickly and efficiently. Below is an overview of each node and its intended use, organized by category.

## Node Overview

| Category          | Node Name                           | Description                                                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Image**         | 🐐 **Image Tiler**                  | Breaks an image into smaller tiles for processing.             |
|                   | 🐐 **Image Untiler**                | Seamlessly reassembles tiles into a full image.                           |
|                   | 🐐 **Get Side Length Of Image**     | Retrieves the wanted side length of an input image.                   |
|                   | 🐐 **Advanced Upscale Image**       | Upscales an image using an upscale model.            |
| **Math**          | 🐐 **Capped Int (Positive)**        | Restricts an integer input within a positive range.            |
|                   | 🐐 **Capped Float (Positive)**      | Restricts a float input within a positive range.               |
|                   | 🐐 **Int Divide (Rounded)**         | Divides two integers and rounds the result to an integer.                    |
| **Postprocessing**| 🐐 **Fast Film Grain**              | Quickly adds realistic film grain to an image.                 |
|                   | 🐐 **Fast Color Match**             | Quickly matches colors between two images.     |
